==  Introduction +
==  Key Features +
==  Getting Started +

=== Launching the Application

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest version of `Mobilize` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to store Mobilize in.
.  Double click on the icon to launch the application.

=== Knowing the Interface

Mobilize comes with a simple interface to facilitate easy planning. It contains six main components that allow you to 
interact with the application: +

image::Ui.png[width="790"] +

Each component has different functions:

* *`Command Line`:* This is your primary mode of input. All major functions have a command in the command line.
* **`Result Display`:** This is your primary mode of interaction with the application. You will be notified of all 
successful or failed commands, along with their correct usages through the Result Display.
* **`Contact Cards`:** These are arranged in a panel to display all the contacts you add into the application. Contact 
Cards show you all entered fields of a contact.
* *`Task Cards`:* These are arranged in a panel to display all the tasks you add into the application. Task Cards show 
you all entered fields of a task.
* *`Browser`:* This is built into the application to redirects you to the location of a contact’s address when a Contact 
Card is clicked.

== Using Mobilize

==== Formatting Commands

For the following tutorials, command formatting will be explained using the following syntax:

* Words or letters followed by a slash (/) are prefixes, to mark the place of a specific parameter. +
  For example, in the syntax n/NAME, the combination of “n/” forms a prefix to signal that the parameter that follows 
  should be a name.
* Words in UPPER_CASE are parameters to be determined by the user. +
  For example, in the command add n/NAME, the word NAME is a placeholder for the name of a contact input by a user. The 
  final command might look like add n/John Doe.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
  For example, if a command syntax contains the item [t/TAG], it means that tags can be left out in the final command.
* Items followed by “…” can be repeated multiple times. +
  For example, if a command syntax contains the item [t/TAG]…, then the final command can contain multiple ‘tags’, 
  such as t/friend, t/family, t/classmate.
* Parameters that are preceded by a prefix, can occur in any order. +
  For example, if a command syntax contains the item add n/NAME p/PHONE a/ADDRESS, then the final command can contain 
  these items in mixed order, such as add a/ADDRESS n/NAME p/PHONE.
  
  [NOTE]
  This is not applicable for parameters without a prefix. For example, if a command syntax uses: edit INDEX n/NAME, 
  then the INDEX parameter MUST be in the exact position as in the syntax, in this case, after the command word 
  i.e. edit.

=== Managing Contacts

==== Adding new contacts : `add`

Whether you’ve just met a new colleague or reconnected with an old friend, adding new contacts to Mobilize is easy! +

Simply key in your contact details in the following way: +

`add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS b/BIRTHDAY [t/TAG]…` +

Hit enter and you should see a success message in the Result Display: +

`New Person Added: NAME Phone: PHONE Email: EMAIL Address: ADDRESS Birthday: BIRTHDAY Tags: [TAG1][TAG2]…` +

Here is an example to illustrate: +

`add n/John Doe p/92435671 e/john_d888@gmail.com a/ 207 Upper Street, Islington, LONDON, N1 1RL b/15111986 t/friend t/roommate` +

Result Display: +

`New Person Added: John Doe Phone: 92435671 Email: john_d888@gmail.com Address: 207 Upper Street, Islington, LONDON, N1 1RL Birthday: 15111986 Tags: [friend][roommate]` +

Congratulations, you now have your first contact! +

__Constraints__

Note the following constraints in the requirements for adding contacts: +

****
* All fields must be provided and not blank.
* Duplicate contacts [where all parameters, except tags, are exactly the same] are not allowed.
* NAME must only contain letters in upper or lower case.
* PHONE must contain at least three numbers.
* BIRTHDAY must be a six-digit, continuous number in “ddMMyy” format.
* Every TAG must be preceded by a tag prefix, t/.
****

==== Finding contacts by name: `find`

Whether you’re a social butterfly or a networking master, sifting through numerous contacts can be a tedious task. +

To ease the process, use the format for the find feature to filter people by name: +

Format `find NAME` +

Consequently: +

* The Result Display says “NUMBER persons listed!” to show you the NUMBER of people whose names could be matched to NAME. +

* The list of Contact Cards is filtered to display only the card(s) of the contact(s) who are found.

For example, the command: +

* `find John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any person having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`


[TIP]
The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans` +
 
[TIP]
The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans` +

[TIP]
Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang` +

__Constraints__

* Only full words will be matched e.g `Han` will not match `Hans`


==== Finding contacts by tag : `findtag`

Finds persons whose tags contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `findtag KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****

* Only full words will be matched e.g `Friend` will not match `Friends`
* Multiple tags could be searched together e.g `findtag friends family`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned
****

* `findtag friends` +
Returns `Alex` and `Bernice Yu`
