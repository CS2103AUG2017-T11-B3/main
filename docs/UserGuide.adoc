==  Getting Started +

=== Launching the Application

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest version of `Mobilize` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to store Mobilize in.
.  Double click on the icon to launch the application.


=== Knowing the Interface

Mobilize comes with a simple interface to facilitate easy planning. It contains six main components that allow you to interact with the application: +

image::Ui.png[width="790"]

__Fig: Components of the Mobilize Interface__


Each component has different functions:

* *`Command Line`:* This is your primary mode of input. All major functions have a command in the command line.
* **`Result Display`:** This is your primary mode of interaction with the application. You will be notified of all successful or failed commands, along with their correct usages through the Result Display.
* **`Contact Cards`:** These are arranged in a panel to display all the contacts you add into the application. Contact Cards show you all entered fields of a contact.
* *`Task Cards`:* These are arranged in a panel to display all the tasks you add into the application. Task Cards show you all entered fields of a task.
* *`Browser`:* This is built into the application to redirects you to the location of a contact’s address when a Contact Card is clicked.

== Using Mobilize

=== Formatting Commands

For the following tutorials, command formatting will be explained using the following syntax:

* Words or letters followed by a slash (/) are prefixes, to mark the place of a specific parameter. +
  For example, in the syntax n/NAME, the combination of “n/” forms a prefix to signal that the parameter that follows should be a name.
* Words in UPPER_CASE are parameters to be determined by the user. +
  For example, in the command add n/NAME, the word NAME is a placeholder for the name of a contact input by a user. The final command might look like add n/John Doe.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
  For example, if a command syntax contains the item [t/TAG], it means that tags can be left out in the final command.
* Items followed by “…” can be repeated multiple times. +
  For example, if a command syntax contains the item [t/TAG]…, then the final command can contain multiple ‘tags’, such as t/friend, t/family, t/classmate.
* Parameters that are preceded by a prefix, can occur in any order. +
  For example, if a command syntax contains the item add n/NAME p/PHONE a/ADDRESS, then the final command can contain these items in mixed order, such as add a/ADDRESS n/NAME p/PHONE.

[NOTE]
This is not applicable for parameters without a prefix.
For example, if a command syntax uses: edit INDEX n/NAME, then the INDEX parameter MUST be in the
exact position as in the syntax, in this case, after the command word i.e. edit.

=== Managing Contacts

==== Adding new contacts : `add`

Whether you’ve just met a new colleague or reconnected with an old friend, adding new contacts to Mobilize is easy! +

. Simply key in your contact details in the following way: +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS b/BIRTHDAY [t/TAG]…` +

. Hit enter and you should see a success message in the Result Display: +
`New Person Added: NAME Phone: PHONE Email: EMAIL Address: ADDRESS Birthday: BIRTHDAY Tags: [TAG1][TAG2]…` +

Here is an example to illustrate: +

* `add n/John Doe p/92435671 e/john_d888@gmail.com a/ 207 Upper Street, Islington, LONDON, N1 1RL b/15111986 t/friend t/roommate` +
   Result Display: +
   `New Person Added: John Doe Phone: 92435671 Email: john_d888@gmail.com Address: 207 Upper Street, Islington, LONDON, N1 1RL Birthday: 15111986 Tags: [friend][roommate]` +


Congratulations, you now have your first contact! +



__Constraints:__

****
* All fields must be provided and not blank.
* Duplicate contacts [where all parameters, except tags, are exactly the same] are not allowed.
* NAME must only contain letters in upper or lower case.
* PHONE must contain at least three numbers.
* BIRTHDAY must be a six-digit, continuous number in “ddMMyy” format.
* Every TAG must be preceded by a tag prefix, t/.
****

==== Finding contacts by name: `find`

Whether you’re a social butterfly or a networking pro, sifting through contacts can be a tedious task. +

To ease the process, use the find feature to filter people by name: +

Format: `find NAME` +

Consequently: +

* The Result Display says “NUMBER persons listed!” to show you the NUMBER of people whose names could be matched to NAME. +

* The list of Contact Cards is filtered to display only the card(s) of the contact(s) who are found.

[TIP]
The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans` +

[TIP]
The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans` +

[TIP]
Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang` +

For example, the command: +

* `find John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any person having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`

__Constraints:__

* Only full words will be matched e.g `Han` will not match `Hans`


==== Finding contacts by tag: `findtag`


You can even find people whose tags contain any of the given keywords. +

Format: `findtag KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

[TIP]
The search is case insensitive. e.g `friends will match `Friends`

[TIP]
Multiple tags can be searched together e.g `findtag friends family`

[TIP]
Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned

For example:

* `findtag friends` +
Returns `Alex` and `Bernice Yu`

* `findtag friends family colleagues` +
Returns any person containing tags `friends`, `family` or `colleagues`

__Constraints:__ +

* Only full words will be matched e.g `Friend` will not match `Friends`


==== Editing contacts : `edit` +


Editing existing contacts is an easy way to keep track of people who might be changing                numbers, addresses or even their role in your life.
All you need to do is input a command in the following format to edit a person’s details:

Format: `edit INDEX n/NAME p/PHONE a/ADDRESS e/EMAIL b/BIRTHDAY t/TAG`

When the command succeeds, the Result Display shows:

`Edited Person: NAME Phone: PHONE Email: EMAIL Address: ADDRESS Birthday: BIRTHDAY Tags: [TAG]`

[TIP]
All items are NOT mandatory for editing. Any number between one and multiple items might be given for successful edit. All items left out will continue to have their original PARAMETERS.

An example to illustrate this shows:

`edit 1 n/Jane Doe p/92413567 a/Singapore e/jane@gmail.com b/09081997 t/sister`

Result Display:

`Edited Person: Jane Doe Phone: 92413567 Email: jane@gmail.com Address: Singapore Birthday: 09081997 Tags: [sister]`


Other examples include:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.


* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

+
So there you have it; an easy, editable contact!

__Constraints__

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the last person listing.
* INDEX *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* If a contact is first searched by the “find” feature, then the new index of the contact according to the filtered list of Contact Cards, is what must be used in the INDEX parameter.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* If a tag prefix is given without a TAG PARAMETER, then the tags will be replaced by a blank (deleted) i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

==== Selecting contacts : `select`

Selecting a contact is an easy way to click on their Contact Card without having to use the pointer on the screen.
To execute this command, type:

Format: `select INDEX`

This triggers the browser to display the location of the contact in the index.

Examples:

* `list` +
`select 2` +
Selects the 2nd person in the address book.

* `find Betsy` +
`select 1` +
Selects the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

__Constraints__

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the last person listing.
* INDEX *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

****

==== Listing contacts : `list` +

To go back to the default list of contacts after a round of filtering, use:

Format: `list`

==== Tagging multiple contacts : `tag` +

Tags are a useful way of grouping and labeling contacts. But editing them manually, one by one, can be a tedious process.

. Instead, use:
Format: `tag [INDEX]… t/[TAG]…`

. Multiple contacts will be tagged by the tag(s) set in the parameter.

. The Contact Cards will be updated to display the new tags.

[TIP]
You can add multiple tags to multiple contacts by repeating the tag prefix.

To illustrate, the command:

`tag 1, 2, 3 t/friend t/family` +
Results in all contacts in indices 1, 2 and 3 to be tagged with both [friend] and [family].

__Constraints__

****
* Each index MUST be valid according to the current list of contacts.
* If a contact is first searched by the “find” feature, then the new index of the contact according to the filtered list of Contact Cards, is what must be used in the INDEX parameter.
* Every INDEX must be separated by a comma.
* Every TAG must have a prefix.
****

==== Removing tags from multiple contacts : `detag`

To delete the specified tag of persons identified by the index number, use: +

Format: `detag [INDEX]... [t/TAG]`

For example:

* `list` +
`detag 2 t/friends` +
Deletes the `friends` tag of the 2nd person in the address book.

* `find Betsy` +
`detag 1, 2, 4 t/OwesMoney` +
Deletes the `OwesMoney` tag of the 1st, 2nd and 4th person in the results of the `find` command.

__Constraints__

****
* The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

Format : `delete INDEX`


All information associated with the contact will be wiped away.

To illustrate:

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd person in the address book.

* `find Betsy` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

__Constraints__

Use prefixes:
****
* `from` to denote the date in which the event begins
* `to`, `on` or `by` to denote the date in which the task is due to be completed
****

. The command follows: +
Format: `addtask DESCRIPTION from START DATE to DEADLINE t/[TAG]…`
