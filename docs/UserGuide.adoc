==  Introduction +

Mobilize is an organizing and planning application for the desktop, that allows you to manage your contacts
and tasks easily. You can store, edit, filter and remove contacts
and to-do lists by simply typing commands into the text box.

With its sophisticated yet user-friendly features, Mobilize can help you easily plan and organize your day
with only a few clicks on the keyboard.

==  About +

This User Guide will lead you through the process of downloading and using Mobilize, along with a brief overview of its features and
the different commands which will help you use these features.

All commands are summarized at the end of the guide.

==  Key Features +

Mobilize facilitates planning and management by combining two important features: an address book and a task manager.

=== Address Book

The address book allows you to add, delete, tag, detag, list, find, select and edit contacts.

It accepts the following parameters:

* Name
* Phone
* Address
* Birthday
* Email
* Tags

=== Task Manager

The task manager allows you to add, delete, tag, list, find, select and edit tasks.

It accepts the following parameters:

* Task Description
* Starting Date
* Deadline
* Tags

==  Getting Started +

=== Launching the Application

To launch the application:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest version of `Mobilize` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to store Mobilize in.
.  Double click on the icon to get started.


=== Understanding the Screen Layout

Mobilize comes with a simple screen layout to facilitate easy planning. The screen contains six main parts that allow you to interact with the application: +

image::Ui.png[width="790"]

__Fig: Parts of the Mobilize Screen__


Each part has different functions:

* *`Command Line`:* This is the your primary mode of input. All major functions have a command in the command line.
* **`Result Display`:** This is your primary mode of interaction with the application. You will be notified of all successful or failed commands, along with their correct usages through the Result Display.
* **`Contact Cards`:** These are arranged in a panel to display all the contacts you add into the application. Contact Cards show you all entered fields of a contact and are arranged in alphabetical order
according to the names of your contacts.
* *`Task Cards`:* These are arranged in a panel to display all the tasks you add into the application. Task Cards show you all entered fields of a task and are arranged according to urgency starting from the
nearest deadline.
* *`Calendar`:* This is a calendar that gives a color coded view of all task deadlines and contact birthdays.
* *`Browser`:* This is built into the application to redirect you to the location of a contact’s address when a Contact Card is selected.

== Features

=== Using Mobilize

Command formats will be explained using the following syntax:

* Words or letters followed by a slash (/) are prefixes, to mark the place of a specific parameter. +
  For example, in the syntax n/NAME, the combination of “n/” forms a prefix to signal that the parameter that follows should be a name.
* Words in UPPER_CASE are parameters to be determined by the user. +
  For example, in the command add n/NAME, the word NAME is a placeholder for the name of a contact input by a user. The final command might look like add n/John Doe.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
  For example, if a command syntax contains the item [t/TAG], it means that tags can be left out in the final command.
* Items followed by “…” can be repeated multiple times. +
  For example, if a command syntax contains the item [t/TAG]…, then the final command can contain multiple ‘tags’, such as t/friend, t/family, t/classmate.
* Parameters that are preceded by a prefix, can occur in any order. +
  For example, if a command syntax contains the item add n/NAME p/PHONE a/ADDRESS, then the final command can contain these items in a different order, such as add a/ADDRESS n/NAME p/PHONE.


// tag::switch[]
=== Switching Between Address Book and Task Manager : `switch`

To help you save time to remember all the commands in Mobilize, you can toggle between address book and task manager using:

Format: `switch addressbook` or `switch taskmanager`

[TIP]
You can use `ab` for `addressbook` and `tm` for `taskmanager` in the command.

[NOTE]
The default mode of Mobilize will be address book.

// end::switch[]

=== Managing Contacts

// tag::birthday[]
==== Adding new contacts : `add`

Whether you’ve just met a new colleague or reconnected with an old friend, adding new contacts to Mobilize is easy! +

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [b/BIRTHDAY] [t/TAG]…` +

Examples: +

* `add n/John Doe p/92435671 e/john_d888@gmail.com a/ 207 Upper Street, Islington, LONDON, N1 1RL b/15-11-1986 t/friend t/roommate` +
Creates a new contact and sets the name to `John Doe`, email address to `john_d888@gmail.com`, address to `207 Upper Street, Islington, LONDON, N1 1RL`,
birthday to `15-11-1996` and two tags to [`friend`] and [`roommate`]. +

__Constraints:__ +

Note the following constraints when trying to add new contacts: +

****
* All fields must be provided and not blank.
* Duplicate contacts [where all parameters, except tags, are exactly the same]
are not allowed.
* NAME must only contain letters in upper or lower case.
* PHONE must contain at least three numbers.
* BIRTHDAY must be a eight-digit number in “dd-mm-yyyy” format.
* Every TAG must be preceded by a tag prefix, t/.
* Using multiple parameters after a single prefix will result in only the last parameter being added, if it is valid. e.g. if `add n/John Doe n/Jane Doe` is used,
then the contact will be named `Jane Doe`.
****
// end::birthday[]

// tag::findtag[]
==== Finding contacts: `find`
Whether you’re a social butterfly or a networking pro, sifting through contacts can be a tedious task. To ease the process, you can filter your contact list by name, tag or birthday. +

Format: `find [NAME] [TAG] [BIRTHDAY]` +

[TIP]
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`, `friends` will match `Friends`
 and BIRTHDAY, in the format of DD-MM, will match DD-MM_YYYY. e.g `17-07` will match `17-07-1995` +
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans` +
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`,
 `Bo Yang`

Examples: +

* `find John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any person having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`
* `find friends` +
Returns any person having tags `friends` or `Friends`
* `find 17-07` +
Returns any person having birthday on `17-07`

__Constraints:__

Note the following constraint when trying to find contacts:

* Only full words will be matched e.g `Han` will not match `Hans`, `friend` will not match `friends` and `1707` will not match `17-07`
// end::findtag[]


==== Deleting contacts : `delete`

If you need to clean up your contact list, just delete all those redundant contacts!

Format : `delete INDEX`

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd contact in the list.

* `find Betsy` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the 1st contact in the result list of the `find` command.

__Constraints__

Note the following constraints when trying to delete contacts:

* Deletes the contact at the specified index.
* INDEX refers to the index number shown in the most recent contact listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

// tag::tag[]
==== Tagging multiple contacts : `tag` +

Tags are a useful way of grouping and labeling contacts. But editing them manually, one by one, can be a tedious process.
Instead, you can use the tag command to tag multiple contacts simultaneously.

Format: `tag INDEX… t/[TAG]…`

[TIP]
You can add multiple tags to multiple contacts by repeating the tag prefix.

Example:

`tag 1, 2, 3 t/friend t/family` +
Results in all contacts in indices 1, 2 and 3 being tagged with both [`friend`] and [`family`].

__Constraints__

Note the following constraints when trying to add tags:

* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Each index *must* be valid according to the current list of contacts.
* If a contact is first searched by the “find” feature, then the new index of the contact according to the filtered list of Contact Cards, is what must be used in the INDEX parameter.
* Every INDEX must be separated by a comma.
* Every TAG must be preceded by a tag prefix, t/.
* If a mix of valid and invalid indices are given, then tags will only be added to the valid INDEX without warning. If all indices are invalid, Mobilize will show an error message.
****
// end::tag[]

// tag::detag[]
==== Removing tags from multiple contacts : `detag`

When a tag is no longer in used, you can use the detag command to remove the tag from multiple contacts. +

Format: `detag INDEX... [t/TAG]`

Examples:

* `list` +
`detag 2 t/friends` +
Deletes the [`friends`] tag of the 2nd contact in the address book.

* `find Betsy` +
`detag 1, 2, 4 t/OwesMoney` +

Deletes the [`OwesMoney`] tag of the 1st, 2nd and 4th contact in the result list of the `find` command.

__Constraints__

Note the following constraints when trying to remove a tag: +

* INDEX refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing. +
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ... +
* Every index must be separated by a comma.
// end::detag[]

==== Editing contacts : `edit` +

Editing existing contacts is an easy way to keep track of people who might be changing numbers, addresses or even their role in your life.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [a/ADDRESS] [e/EMAIL] [b/BIRTHDAY] [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
* Any number between one and multiple items might be given for a successful edit. All items left out will continue to have their original parameters. +

Examples:

*`edit 1 n/Jane Doe p/92413567 a/Singapore e/jane@gmail.com b/09-08-1997 t/sister` +
Edits the name of the first contact to be `Jane Doe`, phone number to be `92413567`, address to be `Singapore`, email to be `jane@gmail.com`,
birthday to be `09-08-1997` and tag to be [`sister`]. +

Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st contact to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively. +
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd contact to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

__Constraints__

Note the following constraints when editing contacts:

* INDEX refers to the index number shown in the last contact listing.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* If a contact is first searched by the “find” feature, then the new index of the contact according to the filtered list of Contact Cards, is what must be used in the INDEX parameter.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* If a tag prefix is given without a TAG parameter, then the tags will be replaced by a blank (deleted) i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the contacts' tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.


==== Listing contacts : `list` +
To go back to the default list of contacts after a round of filtering, use the list command.

Format: `list`

as a *single* time for the task.
* If a prefix is used and no subsequent parameter is specified, the task will be added without the associated item, e.g. `add meeting on` will set an empty deadline for the task.
* Different deadline prefixes are *not* allowed in the same command, e.g. `add submit assignment by friday on friday` will result in an error.
* Multiple values for a single deadline prefix for a single task will only result in the *first* value being selected, e.g. the command `add finish quiz by friday saturday` will set the deadline to the upcoming *Friday only* and *not* Saturday.
* Multiple copies of the same deadline prefix with multiple values each will result in the *last* value being selected, e.g. the command `add finish quiz by friday by saturday` will set the deadline to the upcoming *Saturday only* and *not* Friday.

// tag::calendar[]
=== Using the calendar

A calendar is useful for marking the important dates. When you have many deadlines and birthdays to take note, the calendar allows you to view all these important dates at a glance. +

==== Marking the dates

With many contacts and tasks to manage, differentiating the birthdays and deadlines on the calendar can be done with the use of colours.

[NOTE]
The marking of date is done automatically when a contact/task is added, edited or deleted.

Examples:

* A task has deadline on `17-07-2017`. +
The corresponding date on the calendar is marked *red*. +
* A contact has birthday on `09-12-2017`. +
The corresponding date on the calendar is marked *pink*. +
* `17-07-2017` is a date that is a task's deadline and a contact's birthday. +
The corresponding date on the calendar is marked *yellow*. +

__Constraints__

The colour of the date on the calendar is *only updated* when next/previous button for month/year is clicked or when a date on the calendar is clicked.

==== Clicking dates on the calendar

When there is many deadlines or birthdays on the same date, instead of switching between `CommandMode` and using the `find` command, you can just click on the date itself.

Examples:

* `17` on the calendar that represents `17-07-2017` is being clicked. +
Returns task list and contacts list that contains tasks with deadline on `17-07-2017` and contacts with birthday on `17-07-2017` respectively.

__Constraint__

When a date is clicked and it is not a deadline or not a birthday or both, an empty task list or an empty contacts list or both will be shown, which will be represented by a blank field on the application. +

To return to the original task list or contacts list, you can use the `list` command.
// end::calendar[]

=== Saving the data
